// Hooks are nothing but the special functions provided by Playwright that will run before and after each and every test case that we are going to add. 

//Playwright: mainly, we have four different types of hooks. 

//1. beforeAll() : This hook is used to execute the code before the execution of all the test cases. 
//2. afterAll() : This hook is used to execute the code after the execution of all the test cases.
//3. beforeEach() : This hook is used to execute the code before the execution of each test case.
//4. afterEach() : This hook is used to execute the code after the execution of each test case.

test.beforeAll(async () => {
    console.log("This is BEFORE ALL hook");
});

test.afterAll(async () => {
    console.log("This is AFTER ALL hook");

test.beforeEach(async () => {
    console.log("This is BEFORE EACH hook");
});

test.afterEach(async () => {
    console.log("This is AFTER EACH hook");
