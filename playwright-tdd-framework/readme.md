# Playwright TDD/Hybrid framework design - step by step implementation(baby steps)

## 1. Creating a local working directory within the workspace. 
* Example : playwright-tdd-framework
* terminal-command : cd C:\Training\PlaywrightTrainings\June_2026\playwright-tdd-framework

## 2. Install necessary dependencies based on the project requirements. 
1. **TypeScript** — `npm install typescript ts-node @types/node` and `npx tsc --init` for programming language support.
2. **Playwright** — `npm init playwright@latest` (or add `@playwright/test`) for web / API automation with the Playwright.
3. **PostgreSQL** — `npm install pg @types/pg` to connect to a database and perform db validations
4. **Excel** — `npm install excel xlsx` to read or work with spreadsheet data.
5. **PDF** — `npm install pdf-parse` and (in this project) `pdf-parse-new` for PDF utilities.

## 3. Update the global configurations at project level within the package.json and tsconfig.json. 

 * package.json  => "type": "module"   //to import data/functions from other files
 * tsconfig.json =>  "verbatimModuleSyntax": false // TypeScript can remove type-only imports during compilation. 
 * tsconfig.json =>  "types": ["node"] //Include the Node.js type definitions in this project. 

 ## 4. Create the folder structure to maintain different components of the framework. 

 1. commons => To maintain all the common methods related to UI (commons\ui\web-commons.ts), API (commons\api\api-commons.ts), database (commons\db\db-commons.ts), and performance testing (commons\jmeter\jmeter-commons.ts), and of course AI-related (commons\ai\ai-commons.ts) common methods at one place 

 2. config => config.json file to maintain all the configuration-related data or common data for different components like URLs, credentials, database connection-related information, AI connections, etc. 

 3. testdata => To maintain test data related to each and every component like UI (testdata\ui\data.json), API (testdata\api\data.json), database(testdata\db\data.json), AI(testdata\ai\data.json), and performance testing 

 4. utilities => To maintain common methods related to different types of utilities we are going to use in our framework based on our application needs. 
 - Excel Utility (utilities\excel-util.ts)
 - PDF Utility (utilities\pdf-util.ts)
 - DB Utility (utilities\db-util.ts)

5. page-objects => We will obtain page-wise locators (page-objects\page-elements) and page-wise common methods (page-objects\page-steps) separately to implement the page object model design pattern within the framework.
